## How do we measure variation?

### Introduction
Simply measuring the mean of a set of data does not give you any indication about
the **spread** of values in the data. There are a number of ways in which varibility
in the measurements can be calculated, and sometimes used to determine whether your
explanatory variables are affecting your response variables. We will focus on
several measures in this tutorial:

* sample mean
* sums of squares
* variance
* standard deviation
* standard error
* 95% confidence intervals

### Why do I need to know this?
You can drive a car without having to know exactly what a differential is doing,
what is a carburettor is for, or why the engine has a crankshaft. However, if you
have a basic understanding of its mechanics you'll find it easier to diagnose
faults _What is causing that squeaking from the rear axle?_, and avoid expensive
errors _Is it OK to put diesel in a petrol engine?_

The same applies to you as a quantitative biologist. You can't treat your models
as a mysterious black box into which you chuck data and some magic numbers are
returned. You need a basic understanding of how the models work and why, and this
will help you diagnose if anything goes wrong.

Don't worry, we'll keep the mathematics to a minimum, and use graphical and
interactive components where possible.
  



<!-- *Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.* -->

<!-- Write the R code required to add two plus two: -->

<!-- ```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Exercise with Code -->

<!-- *Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.* -->

<!-- Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it: -->

<!-- ```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5} -->
<!-- add <- function() { -->

<!-- } -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Topic 2 -->

<!-- ### Exercise with Hint -->

<!-- *Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.* -->

<!-- Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5: -->

<!-- ```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE} -->
<!-- mtcars -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r print-limit-hint} -->
<!-- head(mtcars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Quiz -->

<!-- *You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.* -->

<!-- Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages: -->

<!-- ```{r quiz} -->
<!-- quiz( -->
<!--   question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?", -->
<!--     answer("base"), -->
<!--     answer("tools"), -->
<!--     answer("utils", correct = TRUE), -->
<!--     answer("codetools") -->
<!--   ), -->
<!--   question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?", -->
<!--     answer("lattice", correct = TRUE), -->
<!--     answer("tools"), -->
<!--     answer("stats"), -->
<!--     answer("grid", correct = TRUE) -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->
